# OSPF Configuration Guide - Cisco IOS

This guide outlines the steps to configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) on Cisco IOS routers.

## 1. Enable OSPF and assign a process ID
Use the `router ospf` command followed by a locally significant process ID:

router ospf 1

## 2. Define OSPF Networks
Specify which interfaces participate in OSPF:

network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 1

## 3. Set Router ID (Optional but recommended)
router-id 1.1.1.1

## 4. Passive Interfaces (Optional)
To prevent sending OSPF Hello packets on unused interfaces:

passive-interface default
no passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/1

## 5. Verification Commands
Use the following commands to verify OSPF:

show ip ospf neighbor
show ip ospf interface
show ip protocols
show ip route ospf

## Notes:
- OSPF uses cost as its metric (based on interface bandwidth).
- Area 0 is the backbone area and must exist in any OSPF domain.
- OSPF Hello interval = 10s by default on broadcast links.
